Catalogue Raisonné
==================

TYPO3 Extension for a catalogue raisonné of works of a composer. 

As discussed on the [TYPO3 mailinglist](http://lists.typo3.org/pipermail/typo3-english/2013-June/086578.html) this repository contains the latest development snapshot of the extension that was used for the [Gluck Gesamtausgabe](http://www.gluck-gesamtausgabe.de/gwv.html).

Due to the particular use case, the extension certainly still has a few rough edges when used for other projects.

Don't despair! Enjoy testing, using or maybe even helping in making this a generic solution for other musicological TYPO3 projects. [We](http://www.digitale-akademie.de) are always happy for any feedback, usecases or joint efforts that help in creating cool digital humanities tools for TYPO3.

Installation
============

1. Create a fresh TYPO3 installation.
2. Install the [paginator extension](https://github.com/digicademy/paginator).
3. Install the catalogueraisonne extension.
4. Import the sample dataset that you will find in the Resources/Private/T3D/ folder of the extension. IMPORTANT: Tick the "Force uids" option before you import the t3d.
5. Have fun with testing.

Note: The TYPO3 version requirement of this extension is set to 4.7 since it has been developed on that basis. It will not work on older versions of TYPO3, but it might work on higher versions (6+) without any problems.
