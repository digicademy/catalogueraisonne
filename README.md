Catalogue Raisonné
==================

TYPO3 Extension for a catalogue raisonné of works of a composer. 

As discussed on the [TYPO3 mailinglist](http://lists.typo3.org/pipermail/typo3-english/2013-June/086578.html) this repository contains the latest development snapshot of the extension that was used for the [Gluck Gesamtausgabe](http://www.gluck-gesamtausgabe.de/gwv.html).

Due to the particular use case, the extension certainly still has a few rough edges when used for other projects.

Don't despair! Enjoy testing, using or maybe even helping in making this a generic solution for other musicological TYPO3 projects. [We](http://www.digitale-akademie.de) are always happy for any feedback, usecases or joint efforts that help in creating cool digital humanities tools for TYPO3.
